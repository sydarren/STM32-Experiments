# STM32 Experiments
 Retesting out some of the functionalities of the STM32 BluePill. (2021-2022)
 
 - Programming was done using Keil uVision5 with pinout interfacing done using STM32CubeMX 
 - Programs are flashed into a stm32f103c8t6 in a bluepill development board I bought online. 
 - STM32 HAL Library functions were called for better code readability and portability.
